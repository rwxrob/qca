Q: Mokokoppium: so i spend a chunk of my time on neovim, from vimscript
   to lua, but in the end i had to drop it because it just wanst
   efficient compared to vscode, and i see that you use regular vim
   without any plugins, so im wondering what your opinion is

Q: What's a UNIX filter and why should care?

Q: ali123492: the problem with writing these shell one liners is always
   the escaping - sed and awk are particularly bad for that

Q: ali123492: if you add a new item in the middle of the list, how do
   you renumber the list?

Q: HypnoSlimyToady: A quick question about vi commands. When I go to the
   end of the line, the cursor never goes beyond the last letter. So
   when I push i to input text, I have to type between that last letter
   and delete it later. Any solutions to this?
